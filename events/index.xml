      <description>A competition that appeals to anglers from Cairns to the coal mines. The Barra Bonanza was launched by the Cardwell Sportfishing Club (CSC) in 2007 to help attract visitors to Cardwell. Initially planned to coincide with the opening of the Barra season in February, torrential rains, flooded roads and the threat of cyclones played havoc with the first three events.
In 2011, just 24 hours before the start of the competition Cyclone Yasi blew in taking with it the contents of the CSC clubhouse, and the $20,000 prize pool.</description>
