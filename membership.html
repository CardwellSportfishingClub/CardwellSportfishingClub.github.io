CSC is one of the very few fishing Clubs in Australia which has its own clubhouse, leased from the Cassowary Coast Regional Council.
<p>The clubhouse houses the History of ANSA memorabilia and we are proud that the organisation has entrusted us with their historical artifacts.
<h3>
Current activities and contribution to the Cardwell Community
</h3>
<p>
The club currently comprises 76 financial members (2017/18 membership), young and old, singles and families, sharing a common
interest in fishing. Through participation, camaraderie, by promoting responsible angling, family values and, in particular,nurturing juniors, members adhere to the principles of our club motto, namely Sport, Conservation and Integrity.
<p>						
Intra-club fishing competitions, weigh-ins and BBQ’s are held monthly, providing members with an avenue for family and social recreation. We are also committed to tag and release, participating in the tagging program that provides vital information
of nursery habitat, fish movement, breeding pattern etc to researchers and fisheries management. This further assists researchers to make informed decisions of sustainable practices.
<p>
<h3>
Member benefits
</h3>
Camaraderie, shared knowledge, fun nights and social events, great BBQ’s and camping trips, informative talks at meetings, “civil war” with great State of Origin nights on the Big Screen and much more.
<p>
Several of our members are trained Junior Development Officers through “Sunfish”
<p>
Events and activities organised by CSC benefit the economy of the community by bringing visitors to Cardwell. To highlight our club’s contribution to the Cardwell Community.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Since 1970 the club has been hosting the annual North Queensland Championships, which is arguably the longest continually running fishing competition in Australia. 45 continuous years of attracting approximately 150 anglers each year to our small town is quite an achievement.
</li>
<p>
<li>
For 34 consecutive years CSC held the annual Cardwell Challenge. In 2008, this event became the Cardwell Barra Bonanza, with a changed format. In future the event will be held on the last weekend in October just before the end of the Barramundi season.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These events attract anglers and families from Mackay to Mossman and westward.
